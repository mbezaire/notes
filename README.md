# Notes about Python
Here are some notes from my Tufts Summer Coding Academy

### If / Else (boolean logic)

Let's talk about boolean logic! Some keywords that we should know here are:
* if: check a condition (you always have one if)
* elif: check a subsequent condition (you can have 0 or more)
* else: run if none of the above conditions apply (you can have 0 or 1 else statements in an if control structure)
